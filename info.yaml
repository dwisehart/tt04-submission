  title:        "Grey-code divide by 10 and 100 of six different ring oscillators"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Select one of six ring oscillators.  If none is selected the system clock is used.  The output will be divided by 10 (uo[0]) and 100 (uo[5]). uo[4:0] together is x1 decemal grey-code of the ring oscillator."
